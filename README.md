## Program Overview

This program implements an HLLC Riemann solver for the full shallow water equations, coded from scratch based on the methodology described by [Hou et al. (2015)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815214003648). The case study in the paper simulates the 1993 tsunami that struck Okushiri Island, off the west coast of Hokkaido, Japan. The focus is Monai Valley on the islandâ€™s southwestern coast, where an extreme vertical runup of 30 metres was recorded. The current simulation predicts a maximum runup of approximately 32 metres (to scale), closely matching field observations.
